# Sitemap Crawler and Cache Warmer
A simple bash script to warm your page cache
That works for sitemaps generated by Yoast SEO for WordPress, as it crawls a master sitemap and loops through the sub-sitemaps.

If you want to use it for a single sitemap, remove the wrapping loop.

1. Replace your static cache dir
2. Put your sitemap url
3. You are free to go :)
